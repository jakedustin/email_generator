Hi {n},
This email is to inform you that due to a lack of payment on the part of the
customer, we are voiding and cancelling invoice
#{i}, dated {d}, for ${a} as part of an overdue invoice scrub
requested by finance senior leadership. You will notice that this will
count against your current quarter QR, as we cannot go back and retroactively
deduct QR from previous years. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions you have!
Thanks,
